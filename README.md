## Netfix

This is a completely fragile chrome extension that prevent Netflix from auto-playing previews (because it's not 1997 anymore).  It would be better to implement this logic in a firewall rule at the router/gateway, which would block previews on all devices.  However, this (currently) works for the browser.
